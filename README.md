# 3-PC Network Connectivity Project

## 📌 Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## 🧠 Objective
To build and test a basic local area network (LAN) of 3 PCs to understand IP addressing and connectivity.

## ⚙️ What I Did
- Connected 3 PCs to a switch
- Assigned static IP addresses to each PC
- Used the `ping` command to check if devices communicate
- Verified that all 3 PCs can talk to each other
